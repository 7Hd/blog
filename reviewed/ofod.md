    * Buyers of calls
    * Sellers of calls
    * Buyers of puts
    * Sellers of puts.
  * `buyers` are referred to as having `long positions`;
  * `sellers` are referred to as having `short positions`.
* Three broad categories of traders can be identified: `hedgers`, `speculators`, and `arbitrageurs`.
  * Hedgers use derivatives to reduce the risk that they face from potential future movements in a market variable.
    * 對沖: 降低未來走勢的風險
  * Speculators use them to bet on the future direction of a market variable.
    * 投機: 未來方向打賭
  * Arbitrageurs take offsetting positions in two or more instruments to lock in a profit.
    * 套利: 多個工具來抵銷部位
* There is a fundamental difference between the use of forward contracts and options for hedging.
  * Forward contracts are designed to neutralize risk by fixing the price that the hedger will pay or receive for the underlying asset.
    * 期貨使對沖用固定價格來抵銷風險
  * Option offer a way for investors to protect themselves against adverse price movements in the future while still allowing them to benefit from favorable price movements.
    * 選擇權提供對沖免受不利波動且仍然可從有利波動中受益
    * options involve the payment of an up-front fee.
      * 選擇權最初需付費
* Futures and options are similar instruments for speculators in that they both provide a way in which a type of leverage can be obtained
  * 對投機而言期貨與選擇權類似
  * When a speculator uses futures, the potential loss as well as the potential gain is very large.
    * 期貨收益風險都很大
  * When options are used, no matter how bad things get, the speculator’s loss is limited to the amount paid for the options
    * 選擇權最多損失為購買選擇權的費用
* Arbitrageurs are a third important group of participants in futures, forward, and options markets.
  * Arbitrage involves locking in a riskless profit by simultaneously entering into transactions in two or more markets.
    * 套利透過多個市場交易來產生無風險利潤
